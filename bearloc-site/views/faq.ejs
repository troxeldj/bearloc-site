      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h3 class="faq__question">What is the goal of the Bearloc App?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        With the bearloc app we aim to save students at the University of
        Cincinnati time, money, and help them avoid housing scams. We believe
        finding quality housing is important for everyone.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq__question">How large is the Bearloc Team?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        The Bearloc development team is currently comprised of four members. Our
        support team is also four members and handles all user and admin support
        requests.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq__question">
        Why does Bearloc only Serve the University of Cincinnati?
      </h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        By focusing on a small locale we can focus more on the quality of the
        listings and the application as a whole. Our goal isn't to cover a wide
        geographic location but to provide the best possible user experience to
        the area we cover.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq__question">
        My Home Screen Mentions and Update. What do I do?
      </h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        This means that the development team is currently updating the
        application. Features of the application may not work during this time.
        There is nothing that you have to do; check back later.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq__question">
        How long does it take to get an email response?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Users should receive a response to an email query within 2 business days
        after sending a message. If it has been longer than 2 business days, we
        recommend sending the message again.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq__question">
        Does the Bearloc Team Plan on Releasing a Mobile App?
      </h3>
      <p>
        No. We currently do not plan on releasing a mobile application. Our web
        application is meant to be accessible to everyone and work on mobile.
